## The Problem

Modern browsers are designed to keep you browsing. More tabs, more tracking, more data vultures, more history, more extensions, more complexity. The result? Dozens of open tabs you'll "get to eventually," fractured attention, and digital clutter that drains your focus and steals your privacy.

## The Solution

**HiWave** flips the script. We built a browser that actively helps you browse *less* — in a good way.

- **The Shelf** — Tabs you're not using decay and fade away, so you don't have to manually manage them
- **Workspaces** — Separate contexts (work, personal, research) that don't bleed into each other
- **Built-in Privacy** — Ad and tracker blocking with no extensions needed
- **Three Modes** — Choose your level of automation: do it yourself, get suggestions, or let Flow handle it

## The Engine

Unlike browsers that wrap Chromium or WebKit, **HiWave runs on RustKit** — our own browser engine written from scratch in Rust. No Blink, no WebKit, no Gecko. Just ~50,000 lines of original Rust code handling everything from HTML parsing to GPU compositing.

Why build our own engine?
- **Full control** — We can innovate on features other browsers can't touch
- **Memory safety** — Rust prevents entire classes of security vulnerabilities
- **Minimal footprint** — No legacy code, no compatibility cruft
- **True independence** — We don't inherit another engine's priorities or limitations

---

## Features

### 🗂️ The Shelf
Park tabs for later without leaving them open. Shelved items show their age, naturally fading so forgotten pages don't haunt you forever.

### ⏰ Tab Decay
Unused tabs gradually fade, giving you visual cues about what's actually important. In Flow mode, old tabs automatically shelve themselves.

### 🛡️ Flow Shield
Native ad and tracker blocking powered by Brave's engine. No extension required. Just fast, private browsing out of the box.

### 🔐 Flow Vault
Built-in password manager with AES-256 encryption. Your credentials stay local and secure.

### 🗃️ Workspaces
Separate your browsing contexts completely. Work tabs stay in Work, personal stays in Personal. Switch instantly with keyboard shortcuts.

### ⌨️ Keyboard First
Power users rejoice. Everything is accessible via keyboard:
- `Ctrl+K` — Command palette (search anything)
- `Ctrl+Shift+S` — Shelve current tab
- `Ctrl+B` — Toggle sidebar
- `Ctrl+1-9` — Jump to specific tab

### 🎛️ Three Modes
| Mode | For | What It Does |
|------|-----|--------------|
| **Essentials** | Control freaks | Manual everything |
| **Balanced** | Most people | Smart suggestions |
| **Flow** | Trust the system | Full automation |

## Download

### Latest Release

| Platform | Download |
|----------|----------|
| Windows (x64) | [hiwave-windows-x64.zip](#) |
| macOS (Intel) | [hiwave-macos-intel.dmg](#) |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | [hiwave-macos-arm64.dmg](#) |
| Linux (x64) | [hiwave-linux-x64.AppImage](#) |

> **Note:** HiWave is currently in alpha. Expect some rough edges!

### Build from Source

```bash
# Prerequisites: Rust 1.75+, Visual Studio Build Tools (Windows)
# See INSTALL.md for detailed platform-specific instructions

git clone https://github.com/hiwavebrowser/hiwave-windows.git
cd hiwave-windows

# Build with RustKit engine (default)
cargo build --release -p hiwave-app

# Run
cargo run --release -p hiwave-app
```

> **Note:** RustKit is our custom Rust-native browser engine rendering all web content.

### Run Modes

HiWave supports multiple rendering modes on Windows:

| Mode | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **RustKit Hybrid** (default) | `cargo run --release` or `.\scripts\run-rustkit.ps1` | RustKit for content, WebView2 for chrome UI |
| **WebView2 Fallback** | `.\scripts\run-webview2.ps1` | System WebView2 for all rendering |
| **Native Win32** (experimental) | `.\scripts\run-native-win32.ps1` | 100% RustKit (work in progress) |

#### RustKit Hybrid Mode (Default) ⭐
```powershell
# Using convenience script
.\scripts\run-rustkit.ps1

# Or directly with cargo
cargo run --release -p hiwave-app
cargo run -p hiwave-app --no-default-features --features rustkit
```

Hybrid mode uses **RustKit for all web content**, WebView2 only for browser chrome:
- ✅ **All websites rendered by RustKit** - Wikipedia, Twitter, YouTube, etc.
- ✅ Engine-level ad/tracker blocking via Brave's adblock-rust
- ✅ Memory-safe Rust rendering pipeline
- 🎨 Browser chrome (tabs, address bar) uses WebView2 for stability
- ⚡ Best balance of performance and compatibility

**This is what the demo video shows!**

#### WebView2 Fallback Mode
```powershell
.\scripts\run-webview2.ps1

# Or directly with cargo
cargo run -p hiwave-app --no-default-features --features webview-fallback
```

WebView2 fallback uses Microsoft Edge WebView2 for all rendering:
- ✅ Maximum web compatibility
- 🔍 Useful for debugging RustKit-specific issues
- 🌐 Full Chromium rendering support

#### Native Win32 Mode (Experimental)
```powershell
.\scripts\run-native-win32.ps1

# Or directly with cargo
cargo run -p hiwave-app --no-default-features --features native-win32
```

**Status:** Work in progress. This mode aims to use RustKit for everything (chrome UI + content):
- 🚧 Currently being developed
- 🚀 Will use 100% Rust rendering when complete
- 🔧 No wry/tao/WebView2 dependencies
- ⚡ Fastest startup and lowest memory when done

## Philosophy

### Attention over Tabs
We don't measure success by how many tabs you open. We measure it by how focused you stay.

### Simplicity over Extensibility  
No extension ecosystem. Features are built-in, tested, and integrated. One browser, one experience.

### Privacy by Default
Tracking protection isn't an add-on, it's foundational. We don't collect your data. Period.

### Modern Web Only
We target post-2020 web standards. No legacy cruft, no compatibility hacks for sites that should've been updated years ago.

### Opinionated but Respectful
We have strong opinions about how browsing should work, but we offer three modes so you can choose your level of buy-in.

## Architecture

HiWave is built on **RustKit**, our ground-up browser engine. This isn't a WebKit/Chromium wrapper — it's original code:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Chrome Layer (Browser UI)              │
│  Tabs • Address Bar • Sidebar           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  RustKit Engine (Original)              │
│  HTML → DOM → CSS → Layout → Paint      │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## FAQ

**Q: Why not just use Firefox/Brave/Arc?**
A: They're great browsers! But they all share engines (Gecko, Blink) with decades of legacy code. HiWave's RustKit engine is written from scratch — no inherited complexity, no compatibility hacks. Plus, none of them have The Shelf, tab decay, or our philosophy around reducing cognitive load.

**Q: You built your own browser engine? Really?**
A: Yes. RustKit is ~50,000 lines of original Rust code. We wrote our own HTML parser, CSS engine, layout system, and more. It's not a WebKit fork or Chromium wrapper.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**  
A: Not yet. We're in alpha. Use it as a secondary browser while we iron out the kinks.

**Q: Will there be a mobile version?**  
A: Eventually! Desktop is the priority for now.

**Q: How do you make money?**  
A: We don't yet. Future plans include optional HiWave Sync (paid) and possibly search partnerships. We will never sell your data or show ads.
